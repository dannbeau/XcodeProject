# XcodeProject.framework
This framework allows you to read/write Xcode project files (xcodeproj) and workspaces (xcworkspace) from a Swift application.

Goals of the project are to not only be able to read and write a project file exactly as Xcode would but to allow the creation of new projects and the manipulation of existing ones.
